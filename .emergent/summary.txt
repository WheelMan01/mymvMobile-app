The trajectory details a complex and often difficult development cycle. The initial task was to fix the success feedback on the Add Insurance form. This simple task was derailed by a series of major application-breaking issues, primarily stemming from a failed attempt to upgrade the Expo SDK and its dependencies (like React 19 and expo-router v6). This led to a prolonged debugging phase characterized by login failures, blank/black screens, and dependency conflicts.

A recurring and critical problem was the inconsistent and incorrectly cached backend URL, which caused persistent login and data-fetching failures. The AI engineer spent significant effort diagnosing and fixing this, often by clearing Metro bundler caches and restarting services. After numerous failed attempts to fix the upgraded app, the engineer correctly decided to downgrade the dependencies back to a previously stable state, which resolved the core application crashes.

With the app stabilized, the engineer successfully implemented the original requests: fixing the save-and-navigate behavior for the Insurance, Finance, and Roadside forms, adding dynamic provider lists, and implementing auto-refresh on list screens using . The latest request from the user is to build a detailed insurance summary page, for which they provided a comprehensive guide. The last action taken was creating the file for this new screen.

<product_requirements>
The myMV Customer Mobile App is a vehicle management tool built with Expo and a FastAPI backend. The core goal is to provide users with a central place to manage their vehicle-related products like insurance, finance, and roadside assistance.

**Initial Request & Resolution:**
The primary task was to fix the user experience in the Add Product forms (Insurance, Finance, Roadside). After saving, the app would stay on the form screen with no feedback. The implemented solution ensures that upon a successful save, the app navigates back to the respective list screen, which then auto-refreshes to show the new entry.

**Major Detour (App Instability):**
A significant portion of the work involved recovering the app from a broken state caused by a problematic SDK upgrade. This led to a series of critical bugs including login failures, CORS errors, and app crashes (black/white screens), which have since been resolved by downgrading dependencies.

**Current Feature Development:**
The current task is to build a detailed view for insurance policies. When a user clicks on an insurance policy from the list, they should be taken to a new screen that displays comprehensive details and provides action buttons for: Calling the provider, visiting their website, renewing the policy, editing, and deleting the policy.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Dependency Management**: The project underwent a failed major version upgrade (Expo SDK 54, React 19) and a subsequent downgrade to restore stability. Careful management of , , and  versions is critical.
- **State-driven Navigation**: Using  hook from React Navigation to trigger data refetches when a screen comes into focus, ensuring lists are always up-to-date.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Using 's file-based routing to create dynamic detail pages, such as .
- **API-Driven Forms**: Form pickers (e.g., Insurance Providers, Finance Lenders) are populated by fetching data from dedicated backend API endpoints.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a full-stack project with a React Native (Expo) frontend and a Python (FastAPI) backend.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Importance**: The form for adding a new insurance policy. It was the epicenter of the initial bug fixes.
  - **Changes**: The  function was modified to remove the web-problematic  and now directly calls  upon successful API submission. The date picker was replaced with a formatted text input.

- ** & **
  - **Importance**: Forms for adding Finance and Roadside assistance products.
  - **Changes**: They were updated to mirror the functionality of the insurance form, including fetching providers from an API (, ) and implementing the save and navigate back behavior.

- ** &  & **
  - **Importance**: These files display the lists of the user's respective products.
  - **Changes**: The  hook was added to each file. This hook refetches the product list from the API every time the user navigates to the screen, ensuring newly added items are immediately visible.

- ****
  - **Importance**: The main dashboard/home screen of the application.
  - **Changes**: The code for rendering the count badges on the navigation tiles was removed, as requested by the user, to simplify the UI.

- ****
  - **Importance**: This is the new, dynamically routed screen for displaying the details of a single insurance policy.
  - **Changes**: This file was just created and is currently a placeholder. It is the focus of the current task.

- ****
  - **Importance**: Defines all frontend dependencies.
  - **Changes**: This file was heavily modified during the SDK upgrade/downgrade cycle. It now contains the stable, downgraded versions of , , , etc., that are known to work.

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Typography System**: Apply the new system fonts ( for iOS,  for Android) and font weights across all ~30 files in the app, as per the phase-in plan.
- **Propagate Detail Pages**: After completing the insurance detail page, create similar detail, edit, and delete functionality for the Finance and Roadside assistance sections.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The current task is the implementation of the **Insurance Policy Detail Screen**, based on a comprehensive guide provided by the user. The goal is to create a new page that a user navigates to when they tap on an insurance policy in the list.

This new screen, located at , will display:
- Vehicle information.
- Policy details (number, premium, expiry).
- An Expiring Soon status tag based on the expiry date.
- Five action buttons: Call Provider, Visit Website, Renew Now, Edit Details, and Delete.

The implementation will involve fetching detailed policy data (including provider contact info which the backend auto-joins), vehicle data, and using React Native's  API for the call and website buttons. The Edit and Delete buttons will trigger navigation to an edit form or an API call to delete the policy, respectively.

The previous engineer's last action was to create the placeholder file for this new screen: . The immediate next step is to make the items in the insurance list () tappable so they navigate to this new detail screen.

<optional_next_step>
Update  to wrap each list item in a  that navigates to the new detail screen , passing the  as a parameter.
