The trajectory documents a multi-stage debugging process for a myMV Customer Mobile App. The initial task was to fix data display issues on several pages (Insurance, Roadside, etc.) by correcting how nested JSON data from the API was accessed. This was seemingly completed. However, the user then reported a total failure of data fetching (fetching errors no data in app at all).

A deep investigation revealed the root cause: the Expo app was incorrectly calling a local backend instance instead of the specified live backend (). This was due to an incorrect  in the  file, compounded by browser caching of the old app bundle. The AI correctly identified this, updated the  file, and instructed the user to perform a hard refresh, which resolved the primary connection issue.

Immediately after, the user reported two new, more specific bugs: incorrect data counts on the dashboard and a fetching error on the service booking page. The AI's last actions were investigating these by reading the dashboard component file () and the application logs. It discovered the dashboard counts were hardcoded and the service booking page was not handling a 404 error gracefully. The primary language is English, and subsequent responses should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build and refine the myMV Customer Mobile App, a React Native/Expo application for vehicle and service management. It must integrate with a live FastAPI backend at .

**Core Features:**
- **Authentication:** Email/PIN login.
- **Dashboard:** A summary view of the user's services.
- **Vehicle Management:** List and view vehicle details.
- **Service Management:** Dedicated sections for Insurance, Roadside Assistance, Finance, and Service Bookings.

**Development & Current State:**
The project began with the app mistakenly built against a local backend, requiring significant refactoring to connect to the live API. This involved correcting API data structures, environment variables, and resolving caching issues. Authentication and fetching data for vehicles, insurance, and roadside assistance now work. However, the dashboard displays incorrect counts, and pages for services with no backend data (like Service Bookings) do not handle the error state correctly, getting stuck in a fetching loop. The current task is to fix these UI/UX issues.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo,  for file-based routing.
- **State Management:** React Context API () for user session and token management.
- **API Communication:**  for making JWT-authenticated requests to the backend.
- **Environment Configuration:** Use of  file for the , which was a critical point of failure and debugging.
- **Debugging:** Extensive use of  for direct API testing, and analysis of  logs for both frontend (Expo) and backend (FastAPI).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo structure with a React Native/Expo frontend and a FastAPI backend. Development has been focused on correcting the frontend's interaction with a pre-existing live backend.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Importance:** This file is the single source of truth for the backend API URL. An incorrect value here was the root cause of major 500 Internal Server Error issues, as it pointed the app to a local proxy instead of the live backend.
  - **Changes:** The  was updated from  to the correct live backend URL .

- ** & **
  - **Importance:** These files are examples of service pages that display data fetched from the API.
  - **Changes:** Both files were heavily modified. The data access logic was updated to parse a nested JSON response (e.g., from  to ). The TypeScript  definitions and the JSX rendering logic were updated to match the actual field names returned by the live API (e.g., , ).

- ** (Dashboard)**
  - **Importance:** This is the main landing screen after login. It is supposed to show a summary of the user's assets.
  - **Changes:** This file is the focus of the current task. It was read, and the investigation revealed it hardcodes the counts for Insurance and Roadside to 0 instead of fetching the real data, which is what the user reported as a bug.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This page is meant to display service bookings. Its failure handling is representative of a current UX problem.
  - **Changes:** Investigation of logs showed this page receives a 404 Not Found error from the API (as expected, since no data exists), but the UI gets stuck on a fetching service message instead of displaying a No data available message. This is part of the current task to fix.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Dashboard Counts:** Modify the dashboard component () to fetch and display the actual counts for insurance policies and roadside assistance plans from the API.
- **Improve Error Handling:** Update the Service Booking page () to handle 404 API errors gracefully by showing a No data available message instead of getting stuck in a fetching state.
- **Implement Missing Features:** Long-term tasks include adding advanced filtering, offline mode, and biometric authentication as per the original product spec.

<current_work>
The most recent task was to investigate two bugs reported by the user after the major backend connection issue was resolved.

1.  **Incorrect Dashboard Counts:** The user noted that the dashboard showed '0' for insurance and roadside assistance, despite data being present on the respective pages.
2.  **Service Booking Error:** The user reported the service booking page was perpetually stuck on a fetching service message.

The AI engineer began investigating by reading the dashboard component file () and confirmed that the counts for insurance and roadside assistance were hardcoded to .

Simultaneously, the AI checked the application logs and saw that the API call for service bookings was correctly returning a  error, as there is no data for that user. This confirmed that the frontend component for service bookings lacks proper error handling to manage a 404 response and is not exiting its loading state.

The trajectory concludes just as the AI has diagnosed these two distinct problems and is preparing to implement the fixes.

<optional_next_step>
I will start by fixing the dashboard. My next step is to edit  to fetch the counts for insurance and roadside assistance from their respective API endpoints instead of using hardcoded values.
