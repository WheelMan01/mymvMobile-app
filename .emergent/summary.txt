The trajectory documents an extensive and complex debugging journey for a myMV Customer Mobile App. The process involved multiple pivots and deep-dives to resolve a cascade of issues originating from a fundamental misunderstanding of the backend environment.

Initially, a total data failure was traced to an incorrect  in the  file, pointing the app to a local proxy instead of the live backend. This was compounded by Metro bundler caching, which required aggressive cache clearing and process restarts to resolve.

Once connected to the correct live backend (), a series of data structure and API endpoint mismatches were uncovered. The AI systematically corrected the Finance page, which was calling a non-existent endpoint ( instead of ) and expecting fields not present in the API response. It also fixed the dashboard, which was incorrectly filtering for active items instead of showing total counts as requested by the user.

Most recently, the AI addressed a navigation issue by creating a new dynamic route for vehicle details (). However, this new page was blank. The final action was diagnosing that the live backend does not have an endpoint for individual vehicle details (), leading to a 404 error. The root cause is now understood, and the next step is to refactor the detail page to work with the existing list endpoint. The user's primary language is English, and all future communications should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The project is to build and refine the myMV Customer Mobile App, a React Native/Expo application for vehicle and service management. The app must integrate with a live FastAPI backend at .

**Core Features & Status:**
-   **Authentication:** Email/PIN login is functional.
-   **Dashboard:** A summary view of the user's assets. Its primary function is to display total counts for vehicles, insurance, roadside assistance, and finance/loans. This feature was recently fixed to show total counts instead of filtered active counts.
-   **Service Sections (Insurance, Roadside, Finance):** Dedicated pages to list service details. These have undergone significant fixes to align with the live API's nested data structures and correct endpoint names. The Finance page, in particular, was refactored to handle the correct API response fields.
-   **Vehicle Management:** A list of the user's vehicles with placeholder images for those missing one. A critical issue was fixed where clicking a vehicle attempted to open a web URL; this now navigates to an in-app detail screen. However, this detail screen is currently not loading data.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo,  for file-based routing.
- **API & State:**  for authenticated API calls, React Context () for session management.
- **Backend Interaction:** Heavy debugging related to  in , involving confusion between a local proxy and the live backend.
- **Data Handling:** Correcting frontend data access patterns to match nested API responses (e.g., ) and fixing mismatches between component props and API field names.
- **Image Display:** Loading remote images from Cloudflare R2 URLs, with local placeholders for null values.

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with an Expo frontend and a FastAPI backend. The focus of the trajectory was almost entirely on the frontend to align it with a pre-existing live backend.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains the , which was the root cause of major connectivity issues.
    -   **Changes:** The URL was changed multiple times, oscillating between a local proxy and the live URL. It is now correctly set to . The debugging process highlighted severe issues with Metro bundler caching of this value.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Displays the user's finance and loan information.
    -   **Changes:** This file was heavily modified. The API call was changed from  to the correct . The  interface and the JSX were updated to match the actual API response, removing references to non-existent fields like  and  and using fields like  and .

-   ** (Dashboard)**
    -   **Importance:** The main landing screen, showing summary counts.
    -   **Changes:** The data fetching logic () was modified to remove client-side filtering for active policies (e.g., ). It now directly uses the length of the returned arrays to display the *total* number of vehicles, insurance policies, roadside plans, and loans, per the user's latest request.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is a new, dynamically-routed page intended to show details for a single vehicle.
    -   **Changes:** This file was created from scratch to solve a navigation bug where  was falling back to opening a web URL. It currently contains boilerplate code to fetch and display vehicle details, but it fails because the API endpoint it calls () does not exist.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Fix Vehicle Detail Page:** The primary pending task is to fix the vehicle detail page () so it correctly displays vehicle data.
-   **Future Features:** Non-urgent, previously mentioned features include adding advanced filtering, offline mode, and biometric authentication.

<current_work>
The immediate work revolves around fixing the vehicle detail page. After the user reported that clicking on a vehicle card leads to an empty screen, the AI engineer investigated the cause.

The investigation involved attempting to  the API endpoint that the new detail page was trying to use: . This API call resulted in a  error.

This confirmed that the live backend does not support fetching a single vehicle by its ID. The only available, working endpoint is , which returns a list of all the user's vehicles.

The conclusion and the current state of work is the diagnosis of this problem. The  component is architecturally incorrect for the given backend API. The planned fix, which has not yet been implemented, is to refactor this component. Instead of trying to fetch a single vehicle, it must fetch the entire list of vehicles from  and then use JavaScript on the client-side to find and display the specific vehicle that matches the ID from the URL.

<optional_next_step>
Modify  to fetch data from the  list endpoint and then filter for the specific vehicle by its ID on the client-side.
