The trajectory documents a bug-fixing cycle initiated by a user report that the Get Token feature was failing in a forked developer environment. The previous AI engineer correctly diagnosed the issue: the application was attempting to authenticate against an incorrect, empty backend () due to a hardcoded URL in the  component.

The engineer's approach was methodical. First, they confirmed the user's observation and used a  to pinpoint the exact location of the error. They then read the  file, identifying the hardcoded URL in three places: the token fetch logic, the button's display text, and a copyable text element. Using file edit commands, the engineer replaced the incorrect URL with the correct shared backend URL: .

After applying the fixes, the engineer restarted the Expo development server to ensure the changes took effect and verified the correction by reading the file again. The final action was to inform the user that a fix has been applied to their current environment, instruct them on how to test it by simply reloading their app, and await their validation. The user's primary language is English, so all future communications should be in English.

The core product requirement is to provide a seamless Dev Auth workflow for developers using forked instances of the mobile app. Since a forked environment has an empty database, standard login is impossible. The solution is a dedicated screen () that allows the developer to connect the app to a shared, populated backend API to acquire a valid authentication token.

The initial implementation was completed, but a critical bug emerged where the Get Token functionality failed. The system was incorrectly pointing to a development-specific backend instead of the required shared backend ().

The most recent work was a direct fix for this bug. The hardcoded URL within the  component was updated to point to the correct shared API. The goal is to ensure the Get Token button now successfully fetches a token, unblocking developer workflows in forked environments. The user is currently testing this fix.

- **Forked Environment Debugging**: Identifying and resolving issues specific to forked instances, such as incorrect backend configurations.
- **Hardcoded Configuration**: The root cause was a hardcoded URL in a component, which is an anti-pattern. The fix involved replacing it with the correct value.
- **Expo Server Management**: Using expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started to apply code changes to the running development server.
- **React Native State/UI**: Modifying a React component's logic and display text to correct the user-facing and functional aspects of the bug.

The application is a standard Expo/React Native project. The development work is concentrated within the  directory.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Summary of why this file is important**: This is the core file for the Dev Auth feature. It contains the UI and logic that allows developers to configure the app's backend URL and fetch an authentication token in a forked environment. It was the sole focus of the recent bug fix.
  - **Summary of the changes made to this file**: A hardcoded, incorrect backend URL () was replaced with the correct shared backend URL () in three places:
    1.  The  handler for the main button, to ensure it pastes the correct URL.
    2.  The text displayed on the button itself.
    3.  The text that can be copied to the clipboard.
    
    The corrected code now ensures all logic and UI points to the correct shared API. For example, the function to set the backend URL was updated to:

<current_work>
The most recent task was fixing a critical bug preventing developers from authenticating in forked environments.

**Problem**: The user reported that the Get Token button on the Dev Auth screen was failing.

**Investigation**: The root cause was identified as an incorrect, hardcoded backend URL in . The app was pointing to an empty, forked backend API instead of the required shared, populated API.

**Action Taken**: The AI engineer edited  to replace all instances of the incorrect URL with the correct shared backend URL (). This corrected the token fetch logic, the button's text label, and a copyable URL string.

**Current State**: The code has been fixed, the Expo server has been restarted, and the app preview is updated. The engineer has instructed the user on how to test the fix by reloading their app. The process is now paused, awaiting user feedback to confirm the authentication flow is working correctly.
