The trajectory details a two-part development cycle. The first part was a critical debugging session. The user reported a white screen issue, which blocked all app functionality. Initially thought to be a simple service restart issue, the root cause was identified as an  tunnel conflict () specific to the forked environment. The previous AI engineer, with the help of a , correctly diagnosed that the forked app was trying to use the same  as the original. The fix involved programmatically generating a unique subdomain, updating the  file, and restarting the expo service, which successfully resolved the white screen.

The second part was a feature refinement based on immediate user feedback. Once the app was working, the user requested a change in the  component. The purple Use Shared Backend button's behavior was simplified: instead of automatically fetching a token, it now only pastes the backend URL into the input field. The button's label was also changed to display the full URL. The engineer implemented these changes and is now awaiting user validation. The user's primary language is English, and future responses should be in English.

The primary goal is to enable a developer to easily connect a forked mobile application to a shared backend API (). This is necessary because a forked environment has an empty database, making standard login impossible.

A Dev Auth feature was created to solve this. It provides a special screen () where a developer can configure the app to point to the shared backend and fetch a real authentication token.

Recent work has focused on refining this workflow. After fixing a critical environment bug (an  tunnel conflict causing a white screen), development pivoted to a user-requested UX improvement. The user requested that the Use Shared Backend button's functionality be simplified. Instead of a multi-step automatic process, the button should now only paste the correct backend URL into the input field. This allows the developer to manually control the subsequent steps of fetching a token and saving the configuration, providing a clearer and more deliberate workflow.

- **Environment Configuration (.env):** Programmatically updated , , and  in  to ensure a unique tunnel for the forked app.

  - **Summary of importance**: This file is critical for configuring the Expo development server, particularly its  tunneling capabilities. A conflict in these settings was the root cause of a major white screen bug.
  - **Summary of the changes made**: The variables , , and  were updated. The original  () was replaced with a dynamically generated unique name (e.g., ) to resolve the tunnel conflict.

- ****
  - **Summary of importance**: This file contains the Dev Auth screen, the primary interface for developers to configure the forked app's backend connection. All recent UX changes have been focused here.
  - **Summary of the changes made**: Based on a user request, the purple Use Shared Backend button was modified:
    1.  The button's title was changed from Use Shared Backend: app-bridge-api to the full URL: .
    2.  The  handler () was simplified. It no longer attempts to fetch a token. Instead, it now only updates the state to paste the URL into the text input and displays a confirmation message: ✅ URL pasted into text box. Now click Get Token and then Save.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- The user needs to test the latest changes to the  component to confirm the new, simplified workflow meets their requirements. This includes verifying the button's new label and its paste-only functionality.

<current_work>
The most recent work was a direct response to a user request to refine the developer authentication workflow. The focus was on the purple button within the  file.

The engineer modified the component to change the button's behavior. Previously, it triggered a multi-step process. Now, its  handler is simplified to only perform one action: it populates the API URL input field with the string .

The button's visible label was also changed to display this full URL, making it clear to the developer what will happen when they click it.

After implementing these code changes, the engineer restarted the
